### This app was mode for the good

What does this mean? This app is meant for everyone who want to start his journey on taking care of themselves, you can choose any path you want either you just want to have a better health, lose/gain weight or just learn more about body building.

### Are you an expert?

No i'm not a professional IFCB PRO but i have studied enough to know what to do to lose and gain weight, what is good or not for your body but as said if you have specific cons that won't let you workout you must ask to a profesional, nutritionist, doctor, etc.

### Why did you make this app?

When i started this journey i had nothing to look for, nor tips and almost all "diets" and "routines" that are on the internet are lying, selling stuff that you don't need so i want to prove that you can do it with the bare mininum and without spending money on it!

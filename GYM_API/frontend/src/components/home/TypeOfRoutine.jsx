        1. Since i receive /routine/calisthenics take advantage of that param to make the request to the server with axios
        2. pseudo code
        axios.get(URL/${param})

        If calisthenics i will receive calisthenics routines
        
        If weights i will receive weights routine

        On MySQL this means
        weights_calisthenics can be
        'weights'
        'calisthenics'

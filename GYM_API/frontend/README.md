## FRONTEND FROM THE GYM API

## To run the project

```yarn```

## Description

This is a simple MySQL, Express, React and NodeJS stack using context for auth on the frontend to persist the user log.

* Due to storage limitations i decided to use image url's instead of the files.
* Refused to use base64 due to the low performance it gives for bigger file sizes.
* ~~Users can download as pdf the routine~~ 
* Removed download as pdf due to CORS policy with some pictures and how the pdf would depend on the user screen because of dynamic width on div.
* All users on this projects are fake and you must provide your own DB with the Schema at '../'
* On this app the user is able to look at routines, make his own routines and get graph about his progress with exercises and bodyweight.
